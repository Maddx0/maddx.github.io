                In the modern age, the World Wide Web/ Internet is basically the visual example of the wild west. What I mean specifically is that it is a visual representation in the digital form where people could witness an example of evolution in real time. 404 starts off with the early stage (what I call - the dark ages) where Wagner explains witnessing first-hand the initial groundwork people had set up.</p> 
          <P>
              Wagner states “… When I was a child, for example, the internet was still indexable; you generally found websites through dictionaries and webrings. Favorites meant something, because finding what you were looking for often took quite a bit of time”. Wagner witnessed the rise and normalization of search engines such as google by it replacing the original analog directory.</P>
           <p>
               Although I didn’t witness that first evolutionary stage myself, I clocked in experiencing the second phase - the early creation of social media such as Myspace and Facebook. Unlike Wagner though, I did enjoy the 90s aesthetic of the internet, but I can’t say that I miss it. Mostly because I was a bit too young to really explore and navigate it.</p>
           <p>
               
            Therefore, I can’t say I’d give up the instant speed that the internet has today. I slightly remember dial-up during my childhood and honestly, if I had to go through that during this modern age then I’d lose all patience completely. It would be cruelly inconvenient. What I do agree with Wagner about is the possibility of what they describe as “…the phenomenon of the self-eating internet” and that “capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love.”</p>
           
           <p>
               Where our opinions differ is that my opinion agrees with the saying of being careful of what you post online since it’ll stay in the web forever - can be horrifyingly true. Especially now a days. Posts from your past will come back to haunt you. Wagner’s opinion states that the “tall tale” is farce. Wagner explains that once a website goes offline or data and resources are dumped then it’s the equivalent of the Library of Alexandria being burnt down.</p> 
           
           <p>  
               The reality is that the data stays forever because someone is granted the opportunity to store the data privately and can have said data resurfaced at their convenience. The web/Internet is a tool, and its importance comes from how it is used as a tool by the user. That is what aids capitalism in shifting the tool into a double-edged sword.</p>
           
           <p> 
               I digress. I’m not well versed in that knowledge so I’d ultimately would have to take Wagner’s word about that. What I can say is that data is the new gold rush. Capitalism banking on user data is what made the internet devolve into something unsavory. On that main concept, I agree with Wagner. In the sub-section ‘Revenge of the Old Internet?’ I found it interesting that Wagner hit the nail on the head (so to speak) in the irony of how Facebook once a symbol of status and professionalism has now turned into a site of encouraged user tomfoolery. </p>
           
           <p>  
               So much so that Facebook had its run-in with the government via the law for its alt-right affiliations and racism. It was once a site for the young and professional and now it’s the site of what I would call the population of users – the fallen.</p> 
           
           <p>  
                This week’s reading of Wagner’s article “404” summed up reminded me of the story of Icarus. Basically, and amazing tool of a creation that had so much potential in its prime that being unable to control its path has unfortunately melted the wings of possibility by soaring too close to the sun (capitalism).
